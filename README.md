Absence web application developed to help keep track of people in a group. It is intended to do one thing: allow the user to display the plans of all people in a group in a way that makes it easy to see who's present and who's absent. It is not intended for anything else. 

This is python port for old fashioned CGI application orginally developed by Robert Urban
Source code for original application can be downloaded from https://www.unix-wissen.de/absence/

Why I ported it?

I liked original app for its simplicity and old fashioned look and feel.
Robert seems no longer maintaining that so I came up with my own Python based version.

Application supports both PostgreSQL and Sqlite database for storing data.
Its built with Python Flask and can be easily started on Docker.

Have fun!
